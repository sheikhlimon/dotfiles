# dotfiles

This repo contains my dotfile configuration.  
These days I primarily use OMARCHY via the [Arch Linux distribution](https://omarchy.org).

I manage the various configuration files in this repo using [GNU Stow](https://www.gnu.org/software/stow/).  
This allows me to set up symlinks for all of my dotfiles using a single command:

```sh
stow .

```
